# What
This extension provides VSCode Github Copilot Aagent a `HumanAgent_Chat` MCP tool that forces AI assistants to communicate through a human agent instead of giving direct responses. When an AI uses this tool, it opens a chat session where humans can respond in real-time.

## Why
The AI Agent is encouraged to discuss with you before running off to do its own thing - if its part way through iterating through on a problem it can stop and ask you a question - it reduces requests considerably, helps avoid runaway agent, allows you to manage multiple VSCode agents working in multiple workspaces from one web page. Allows you to append useful reminders to each response. 
 

## How it works
Just install it and its ready to go.
